#### Sentiment Analysis

Use the [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/) to pull the latest news articles for Bitcoin and Ethereum and create a DataFrame of sentiment scores for each coin.

Use descriptive statistics to answer the following questions:

> Which coin had the highest mean positive score?
>
>     Bitcoin

> Which coin had the highest negative score?
>
>     Bitcoin

> Which coin had the highest positive score?
>
>     Ethereum

#### Natural Language Processing

Will use NLTK and Python to tokenize the text for each coin. 

Next, look at the ngrams and word frequency for each coin.

Finally, generate word clouds for each coin to summarize the news for each coin.



#### Named Entity Recognition

Will build a named entity recognition model for both coins and visualize the tags using SpaCy.
